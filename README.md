<h1>Vue practice</h1>

<p>
After finishing an intensive 6 month full-stack course that used React for the front-end, I have spent the last two weeks studying Vue and its differences from React.

<h3>Todo list</h3>

<p>
After creating my first Hello World, counter and responsive webpage I followed a guide on building a <strong>Todo list</strong>, utilising a store to call actions and mutations on global state. Here I also learned about conditional rendering and using axios to fetch data from an API, and in the future, a server.

<h3>IMDb game</h3>

<p>
Next I built my own app using my todo project as a reference, this time utilising the <strong>IMDb</strong> api to create a game. Here I focused my learning on the differences between methods and computed, and the pros and cons between using local data or the global store in different scenarios. I leaned heavily into conditional rendering, and utilised a persistedState plugin to hold high scores between window reloads.

<h3>Linktree clone</h3>

<p>
My main point of improvement with the IMDb game was that I never split the app into more managable components. For my next project, a <strong>Linktree clone</strong>, I learned a lot about using watch and emit to call methods across components. This was super effective in making my code scalable and easier to read, as I was previously going through the global store for the same result. Watch also taught me a lot about different ways to keep an app responsive as it scales, as a similar effect in React would require a specific update function to be called at the end of each store change in order to trigger, rather than efficiently watching specific data for changes.

<p>
Up until now, I was ignoring css as I wanted to spend as much time as possible learning a new language. However I was confident enough in my app to move towards styling. I learned a lot about scoped/global styles, and the pros and cons between writing the styling directly into a component or importing it from an assets directory.
