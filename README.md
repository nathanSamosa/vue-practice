<h1>Vue practice</h1>

<p>
After finishing an intensive 6 month full-stack course that used React for the front-end, I have spent the last two weeks studying Vue and its differences from React.

<p>
After creating my first Hello World, counter and responsive webpage I followed a guide on building a Todo list, utilising a store to call actions and mutations on    global state. Here I also learned about conditional rendering and using axios to fetch data from an API, and in the future, a server.
</p>

<p>
Next I built my own app using my todo project as a reference, this time utilising the IMDb api to create a game. Here I focused my learning on the differences between methods and computed, and the pros and cons between using local data or the global store in different scenarios. I leaned heavily into conditional rendering, and utilised a persistedState plugin to hold high scores between window reloads.
