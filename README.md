<h1>Vue practice</h1>

<p>
  After finishing an intensive 6 month full-stack course that used React for the front-end, I have spent the last two weeks studying Vue and its differences from React.

<p>
  After creating my first Hello World, counter and responsive webpage I followed a guide on building a Todo list, utilising a store to call actions and mutations on    global state. Here I also learned about conditional rendering and using axios to fetch data from an API, and in the future, a server.
